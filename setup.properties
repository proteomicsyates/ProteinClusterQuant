# ALGORITHM MAIN PARAMETERS, THRESHOLDS AND FILTERS:
#####################################################

inputType = FILE_TYPE
#	This parameter takes into consideration the type/format of data for input into the program. The possible values for the file type are:
#	CENSUS_CHRO - for data that was acquired based on isobaric isotopologue labeling of peptides
#	CENSUS_OUT - from ip2 for data that was acquired in silac format.
#	SEPARATED_VALUES - tab delimited data file containing the following columns:
#		Column 1: PSM identifier
#		Column 2: peptide sequence
#		Column 3: ratio value (not log values!!).
#		Column 4: ratio weight. This value can be any value measuring the quality of the ratio measurement. For example, for iTRAQ ratios, it could be the intensity of the higher peak contributing to the ratio; for SILAC it could be a measurement of the MS1 area divided by the fitting curve quality.
#		Column 5: protein accession [OPTIONAL]. This column can be avoided if a fasta file is provided with the 'fastaFile' parameter.

isobaricRatioType = Rc/Ri
#   This paramter defines which type of ratio is used when using isobaric isotopologues approach, that is, when inputType = CENSUS_CHRO.
#   If this parameter is used with other inputType different than CENSUS_CHRO, it will throw an error. Similarly, if this parameter is empty or is not present when inputType - CENSUS_CHRO, it will throw an error.

quantChannels = TEXT/TEXT
#   In case of having input files containing more than 2 channels (Light over Heavy), you should specify here which ones you want to use for getting the ratios of the analysis
#   The format is a ratio of supported labels (separating them by '/')
#	Possible values of labels are: LIGHT, HEAVY, MEDIUM, TMT_6PLEX_126, TMT_6PLEX_127, TMT_6PLEX_128, TMT_6PLEX_129, TMT_6PLEX_130, TMT_6PLEX_131, N14, N15
#	Default value if not provided: LIGHT/HEAVY

ignorePTMs = TRUE/FALSE  
#   In case this toggle is set to TRUE, peptides modified and not modified will be considered as the same peptide. Otherwise, they will be considered as different and therefore, they will be displayed in different peptide nodes.  
  
collapseIndistinguishablePeptides = TRUE/FALSE
#	In case this toggle is set to TRUE peptide nodes of individual peptides that are connected to exactly the same protein nodes are collapsed into one single peptide node.  It reduces peptide node redundancies in connected components.
#	Default value if not provided: TRUE

collapsePeptidesBySites = TEXT, TEXT, ...
#   In case of having site specific quantitative data, you can specify here in which aminoacid(s) you get the ratios for, and therefore PCQ will perform differently 2 things:
#    - PCQ will parse isobaric isotopologues ratios accordingly to the sites (discarding isobaric ratios from ions that do not exclusively contribute to the site specificity of the quantitation).
#    - PCQ will collapse peptide nodes by sites in proteins. So different peptides that cover the same site of the same proteins, are collapsed together.
#   The values of this property is a comma separated list of aminoacid letters, or just one aminoacid letter if the quantitation has only been performed in one particular aminoacid.
#   If this property is not present or is empty, the peptides will be collapsed by how they are shared with proteins
  
collapsePeptidesByPTMs = TEXT,TEXT  
#	In case of having a PTM analysis you may want to quantify the PTM positions in the proteins. In other words, quantitative values for peptides containing the same PTM will be averaged together even when they are not coming from peptides with the same sequence.  
#	For that purpose, this parameter will specify which PTMs you want to use to collapse quantitative values.
#	The value of this parameter is a comma separated string collection in which each string is like:
# 	- "+79.96@PST", meaning, ptms with a mass shift of +79.96 at P,S or T aminoacids
#	- "K", meaning, any ptm at K aminoacid
#	- "+79.96", meaning, any aminoacid with mass shift of +79.96
	 
#	Default value if not provided: FALSE  
  
createProteinPTMStates = TRUE/FALSE  
#	In case of enabling this parameter (TRUE), protein nodes connected to peptides with modifications will be split to represent the different modifications states that a protein may have, keeping all the possibilities based on their peptides containing PTMs.
#	For example, for a protein p with 3 different PTM sites (PTM1-3), there will be 2^3 = 8 possible protein nodes: non modified p, p with PTM1,p with PTM2,p with PTM3, p with PTM1 and PTM2, p with PTM1 and PTM3, p with PTM2 and PTM3, p with PTM1 and PTM2 and PTM3.
#	In case of having collapsePeptidesByPTMs=FALSE, this parameter will be ignored.
#	Default value if not provided: FALSE

maxNumPTMsPerProtein = NUMERIC_VALUE  
#	In case of setting parameters collapsePeptidesByPTMs and createProteinPTMStates set to TRUE, PCQ will collect all detected PTM sites for each protein and then, it will create a protein node with all combinations of PTMs that support the detected peptides.
#	The example above shows how a protein with 3 different PTMs can derive in 8 different protein nodes. However, you can imagine that a protein with multiple PTM sites could end up generating a huge number of protein nodes which most of them are not interesting. For that reason, this parameter will limit when a protein with multiple PTMs will be split into multiple protein nodes, and that limit will be determined by the number of different PTM sites in the protein.
#	Default value if not provided: 4
#	Recommended values: any value less than 8.  

collapseIndistinguishableProteins = TRUE/FALSE
#	In case this toggle is set to TRUE protein nodes of individual proteins that are connected to exactly the same peptide nodes are collapsed into one single protein node. It reduces protein node redundancies in a connected component.
#	Default value if not provided: TRUE

removeFilteredNodes = TRUE/FALSE
#   In case this toggle is set to TRUE and some filters are applied, if some peptide node is filtered-out, it will be removed from the network, and therefore the network will be rearranged accordingly.
#   In case of being set to FALSE, filtered-out nodes will remain in the output Cytoscape networks (.XGMML files), but they will be color in gray.
#   In any case, filtered-out nodes will not be considered for the ratio integration algorithm or for the classification schematas.

onlyOneSpectrumPerChromatographicPeakAndPerSaltStep = TRUE/FALSE
#	This parameter is only valid MS1-based quantitation data (like SILAC) and inputType = CENSUS_OUT.
#	When this parameter is set TRUE, it means that that only the best PSM will be taken from each chromatographic peak and salt step irrespective whether the quantification was done based on the heavy or the light peak that was identified. It prevents that a chromatographic pair gets included in the calculations twice because it was identified in light as well as in heavy. Note that using DTASelect the parameter -t 1 should be used prior to quantification and use of PCQ.

#	Default value if not provided: FALSE.

ionsPerPeptideNodeThreshold = NUMERIC_VALUE

#	Default value if not provided: 0.

replicatesPerPeptideNodeThreshold = NUMERIC_VALUE
#	This parameter works with the parameter 'replicatesPerPeptideNodeThresholdOn' to define a minimum number of Replicates per peptide node to consider it in further analysis.
#	Default value if not provided: 0.

skipSingletons = TRUE/FALSE
#	This parameter is only valid MS1-based quantitation data (like SILAC) and inputType = CENSUS_OUT.
#	When this parameter is set to TRUE, the singletons (quantified peptides only detected in one of the two conditions) are skipped and not considered in further analysis.  
#	Default value if not provided: FALSE.

labelSwap = TRUE/FALSE
#	This parameter should only be set to TRUE when a label swap experiment is analyzed, e.g. experiments are analyzed simultaneously in which sample 1 was labeled light and sample 2 heavy in one experiment(s) and sample 1 labeled heavy and sample 2 labeled light in another set of experiments. NOTE: use correct operators to denote experiments in parameter 'inputFiles'.
#	Default value if not provided: FALSE.

useMajorityRulesForInfinities = TRUE/FALSE
#	This parameter states how to proceed when averaging set of ratios containing INFINITY values (either positive or negative).
#	If this parameter is set to true, the mayority rule is applied, which means that if there are more non-infinity ratios than infinities, 
#	then it will report the average of the ratios, otherwise report the infinity. 
#	More detailed cases are shown in these examples:
#	- If useMajorityRulesForInfinities=TRUE and we have +INF, +INF, +INF, +2.5, +1.5, then the averaged value will be +INF.
#	- If useMajorityRulesForInfinities=FALSE and we have +INF, +INF, +INF, +2.5, +1.5, then the averaged value will be +2.0.
#	- If useMajorityRulesForInfinities=TRUE and we have +INF, +INF, +INF, +2.5, +1.5, +4.0 then the averaged value will be +4.0.
#	- If useMajorityRulesForInfinities=FALSE and we have +INF, +INF, +INF, +2.5, then the return averaged will be +2.5.
#	Default value if not provided: TRUE.

#      - XPATH: XPath to the XML element containing the information you want to include. It may have a condition value (see examples below)
#      - SUB_XPATH: XPath over the latest (deepest) element in the previous XPATH which indicates the actual value to retrieve from the XML.
#      - COLUMNNAME: name to assign to that property in the XGMML. It will appear as a new column in the data tables in Cytoscape.
#
#   You can specify as many triplets as you want (no separation character):  [tri,plet,1] [tri,plet,2] 
#
#   Example 1:
# 	Consider the following part of one Uniprot XML:
#
#   <dbReference type="Proteomes" id="UP000002282">
#     <property type="component" value="Unassembled WGS sequence"/>
#   </dbReference>
#   <dbReference type="GO" id="GO:0005739">
#     <property type="term" value="C:mitochondrion"/>
#     <property type="evidence" value="ECO:0000501"/>
#     <property type="project" value="UniProtKB-SubCell"/>
#   </dbReference>
#   <dbReference type="GO" id="GO:0005524">
#     <property type="term" value="F:ATP binding"/>
#     <property type="evidence" value="ECO:0000501"/>
#     <property type="project" value="UniProtKB-KW"/>
#   </dbReference>
#
#   You may be interested on including all the GO term names for your proteins, so you want a new column that for this particular protein 
#   will have the value:  "C:mitochondrion, F:ATP binding"
#
#   In order to tell to PCQ to retrieve those annotations you will have to write a triplet like:
#      - XPATH: dbReference$type=GO
#      - SUB_XPATH: property$value
#      - COLUMNNAME: GO_Term_Name
#   So it would be:
#      uniprot_xpath = [dbReference$type=GO, property$value, GO_Term_Name]
#
#   Note that the first XPATH indicates the element you are using to filter the annotations, saying that you want all 'dbReference' elements having
#   an attribute 'type' equals to "GO". The second SUB_XPATH indicates the xpath starting on 'dbReference' element, for the data to retrieve
#   so that you want the attribute 'value' of the subelement 'property' of the element 'dbReference'.
# 
#
#
#   Example 2:
# 	Consider the following part of one Uniprot XML:
#
#   <comment type="subcellular location">
#      <subcellularLocation>
#         <location evidence="1">Mitochondrion</location>
#      </subcellularLocation>
#   </comment>
#
#   You may be interested on including all the subcellular locations of your proteins, so you want a new column that for this particular protein 
#   will have the value:  "Mitochondrion"
#
#   In order to tell to PCQ to retrieve those annotations you will have to write a triplet like:
#      - XPATH: comment$type=subcellular location
#      - SUB_XPATH: subcellularLocation/location
#      - COLUMNNAME: Subcellular_Location
#   So it would be:
#      uniprot_xpath = [comment$type=subcellular location, subcellularLocation/location, Subcellular_Location]
#
#   Note that the first XPATH indicates the element you are using to filter the annotations, saying that you want all 'comment' elements having
#   an attribute 'type' equals to "subcellular location". The second SUB_XPATH indicates the xpath starting on 'çomment' element, for the data
#   to retrieve so that you want the text value (note that here there is no attribute notation '$') of the subelement location in the subelement
#   subcellularLocation on the element 'comment'.
